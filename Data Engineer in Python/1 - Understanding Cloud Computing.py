### Introduction to Cloud Computing

# At its core, cloud computing is the delivery of technology services—like computing power, storage, databases, and networking—over the internet, 
# with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers or data centers, companies can rent access to these services from 
# cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. 

# Physical Servers
# - Traffic increases require more servers
# - Buying or renting servers is expensive
# - If traffic drops, you pay for excess capacity
# - More control and security

# Cloud Computing
# - No owning physical servers
# - Website run on cloud servers
# - Scale up or down instantly based on demand
# - Only pay for what you use
# Security and cost can be an issue


### The Power of the Cloud

# Three main cloud services: Compute, Storage and Databases
# Compute is the brain that processes workloads
# Storage saves files and data
# Databases store data for easy retireval, management and analysis
# Businesses can use all three in combination for powerful cloud solutions

# Virtualisation
# Splits one physical server into multiple virtual servers, each acting like it's own independent machine
# Means better resources efficiency - no wasted space
# Lower costs due to less physcial machines

# Scalability
# Adjust resources based on demand
# Vertical Scaling - Upgrades and existing machines power
# Horizontal scaling - adds more machines to share workload 

# Pay-as-you-go pricing
# Scale up for high demand
# Scale back in slower traffic
# On-premise solutions more cost-effective if traffic is relatively stable

# Speed
# Enables quick launch of services and applications
# Performance and growth are optimsed with the cloud
# On-premise can't compete with constant cloud updates
# Cloud allows quick deploy of services and resources globally

# Reliability
# Cloud providers replicates data across multiple data centres
# Less downtimes
# Fewr outages
# More piece of mind

# Security
# Very important when trusting thrid party with your data
# Some industries have strict regulations now met by many cloud providers
