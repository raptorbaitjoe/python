### Cloud Deployment Models

# Important decision in cloud adoption
# Depends on how much control needed over cloud environment
# Three main types: private, public & hybrid

## Private CLoud
# Designated for exclusive use by its tenants
# Accessed by a network link, special access need set up by IT
# Appealing because gives direct control of resources (i.e tech model) and data storage
# Costs more upfront investment due to structure design, hardware purchase etc.
# Uses virtualisation for on-demand compute resources and can be off-premises

## Public Cloud
# CLoud infrastructure is shared and open for use by the general public
# Infrastructure owned and managed by cloud service providers
# Example: AWS
# Public clouds are internet accessible
# Allows quick start with minimal investment, no need to host or commit to infrastructure
# Can pick what services are needed from provider
# Easier to scale as can by more capacity
# No access to data centre and hardware, data centre locations are secret for security reasons

## Hybrid Cloud
# When and organisation uses two or more distinct models
# Models interact with each other via network link and can share data and services
# Could store sensitive data on a private cloud while using application from public cloud (i.e. BI tool)
# Useful in case of Cloudbursting (private cloud overwhelmed by demand, traffic moved to public cloud instance to avoid disruption of service)

## Other deployment models

# Multicloud
# combination of different cloud provider services
# Flexibility on pricing plans and service offerings
# No reliance on one vendor

# Community model
# Cloud infrastructure shared by specific community for specific use
# Shared interest or concern e.g. security, jurisdiction, mission etc.
# Easier collaboration and sharing of data
# Infrastructure can be managed and hosted internally or externally


### Regulations on the cloud

# Local regulations can affect cloud computing
# Having widespread data centres reduces latency
# Latency - The greater the distance between two points, the longer it will take for data to get there.
# Country-specific regualtion on data processing and storge, for both user and data centre
# Also regulations put on company in home country

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
# Europe-specific
# Regulates how personal data is collected, processed and stored for EU users
# Users must explicitly consent to data collection
# Personal data but be encrypted, anonymised and/or pseudonymised
# Personal data can't leave EU borders unless you can guarantee the same level of data protection
# Fine of 20 million euros or 4% of worldwide revenue
# Brazil, USA, Japan, Thailand and Canada have copycat regulations
# Can influence where companies set up data centres

# Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual
# Different pieces of information, which collected together can leade to identification of a particular person, also constitue personal data.
# PII - Personally Identifiable Information
